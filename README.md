📍A python Project


📝Desription:
A student management system aims to minimize difficulties of institutes and colleges for maintaining student data. In order to maintain student data file is an efficient way. Files can store data as user requires and it also allows to access data from it.

👉The Student Management system is developed using File handling concepts in python. This system allows three basic operations such as: add details of student in file, view file and search particular student from a file. This project provides security for student data as only authorized person can access the file of student details. This is done by providing username and password for each account in account. 


👉This project divides student data in three accounts – 

1. First Year account  
2. Second Year account 
3. Third Year account 

👉For handling this accounts three files are created: 
1. FY_Data.txt  
2. SY_Data.txt 
3. TY_Data.txt 

User can access these files only by entering valid user name and password in log in window. To select particular account, to enter login details and to enter student details a Graphical User Interface is provided for user. For this TKinter is used.
